**Urban Livability Dashboard**

This Streamlit web application analyzes and visualizes the livability of selected Indian cities based on multiple sustainability and quality-of-life indicators, aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 1, 3, 6, 11).

**Overview:**

This data analysis project computes a Livability Index using four equally weighted sub-indices:

Air Quality Index (AQI) - based on PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and SO₂

Population Density Index (PDI) - based on population and area

Health Index (HI) - based on life expectancy and infant mortality rate

Poverty Index (BPL) - based on BPL population percentage

Each sub-index is normalized and combined to produce a composite Livability Index (0-100 scale).

**Key Features:**

City-wise Analysis - explore sub-indices and livability trends for each city.

City Comparison - compare multiple cities and years interactively.

Visualization Dashboard - six professional, interactive Plotly visualizations with results & discussions.

Leaderboard - ranks cities by average livability over the study period.

About Page - project methodology, data sources, and direct SDG mapping.

**Tech Stack:**

Streamlit - Interactive web application development.
Plotly - Interactive, professional graphs.
Pandas - Core data handling and manipulation.
NumPy - Normalization and other calculations.
